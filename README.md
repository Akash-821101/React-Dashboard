## Features:-

1.  Search Functionality : The dashboard includes a search field that allows you to filter users based on their name, email, and role. As you type in the search field, the table updates in real-time to show the matching results.

2.  Table View: The user data is presented in a table format. Each row represents a user with columns for name, email, and role. The table provides an organized view of user data for easy management.

3.  Edit and Delete: You can edit user data directly from the table. Clicking on the "Edit" button opens a form where you can update the user's information. Additionally, you can delete users by clicking on the "Delete" button. A confirmation dialog ensures data integrity.
